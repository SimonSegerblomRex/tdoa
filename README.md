#tdoa
This is the first part of a TDOA-system used for estimating the time differences.

Prerequisites
-------------
The scripts have only been tested with Matlab 2014a (inlcuding the Image Processing Toolbox).
Hopefully they also work with earlier (and later) versions of Matlab.
GNU Octave should also work if you fix `audioread`.

Usage
-----
Download the scripts and Matlab functions and open them in a new workspace.
Run `main`.
