#tdoa
This is the first part of a TDOA-system used for estimating the time differences.

Prerequisites
-------------
The scripts have only been tested with Matlab 2014a (inlcuding the Image Processing Toolbox).
Hopefully they also work with earlier (and later) versions of Matlab.
GNU Octave should also work if you fix `audioread`.

Usage
-----
Download the scripts and Matlab functions and open them in a new workspace.
Run `main`.

Input data
----------
The script takes any number of sound files as input data.
So far only input sound files recored with a sample rate of 96000 Hz have been used to test the scripts.
Different sample rates should also work, but might require some extra tweaking of the settings.

Sample input data will be uploaded eventually!
